Q5. Use Naive bayes, K-nearest, and Decision tree classification algorithms and build classifiers.
Divide the data set into training and test set. Compare the accuracy of the different classifiers
under the following situations:
5.1 a) Training set = 75% Test set = 25% b) Training set = 66.6% (2/3rd of total), Test set =
33.3%
5.2 Training set is chosen by i) hold out method ii) Random subsampling iii) Cross-Validation.
Compare the accuracy of the classifiers obtained.
5.3 Data is scaled to standard format.
